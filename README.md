## PintOS

PintOS is a simple operating system framework for the 80x86 architecture. It supports kernel threads, loading and running user programs, and a file system, but it implements all of these in a very simple way. In this project, we try to strengthen its support in all three of these areas, and also add a virtual memory implementation for it.

Here is a summary of the Project
#### Phase 1
- Wait Queue
- Basic Priority Scheduling

#### Phase 2
- User Program Exeuction
- Process Management
- System Calls

#### Phase 3
- Stack Growth
- Virtual Memory (Paging)
- Memory-Mapped Files

#### Phase 4
- Buffer Cache
- Extensible Files
- Filesystem and Subdirectories
